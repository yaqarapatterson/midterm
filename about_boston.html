                Welcome to Boston, Massachusetts! 
            </p>

                Boston is a beautiful city with an incredible history and an amazing connection to the North Atlantic Ocean.

                The territory of (what is now) Massachusetts was first colonized by the Puritan Separatists who left England aboard the Mayflower ship and arrived and settled in what is now Provincetown, MA in 1620. Boston itself is one of the oldest cities in the U.S. with Massachusetts being one of the first states founded after the American Revolutionary War.

                It has one of the oldest ports in the world and is known for the many historic events leading up to and into the American Revolutionary War. There was the Boston Massacre, Samuel Adams leading the Sons of Liberty to stage the Boston Tea Party. It is the place where Paul Revere lived and worked and aided in warning the colonists of the arrival of the British navy in the beginnings of the revolutionary war. Boston is very near the site where the battles of Lexington and Concord took place and is the site of the Battle of Bunker Hill. Boston was the first state of the union to abolish slavery. It also had the deadly disasters of the Great Molasses Flood and the Cocoanut Grove Fire.

                While a historic treasure, Boston is still a very active city. It is surrounded by some of the best colleges and universities in the world, such as Harvard University, MIT, and Tufts University. It gets very busy for Patriots Day every year for the Boston Marathon. It is home to many fan favorite sports teams as the New England Patriots, Boston Red Sox, Boston Celtics, Boston Bruins, New England Revolution and the Boston Cannons.
